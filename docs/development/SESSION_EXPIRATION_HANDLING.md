# Session Expiration & Authentication Redirect Handling

**Updated:** October 5, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented and Production-Ready

---

## 📋 Overview

This document describes the comprehensive session expiration and authentication redirect system implemented across all dashboard components (Admin, Bank Viewer, and Specialist). The system ensures users are automatically redirected to the login page when their session expires, with clear messaging to avoid confusion.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Previous Behavior
- Users would get stuck on dashboard pages when their session expired
- No clear indication that authentication was lost
- Missing email or user data in welcome messages indicated session issues
- No automatic redirect to login page
- Users would see broken UI elements or empty data without context

### Root Cause
The dashboard components lacked proper authentication checks and session expiration detection, allowing unauthenticated users to remain on protected pages.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Architecture Pattern
All dashboard components now follow a consistent authentication flow:

1. **Loading State Detection**: Check if authentication is being determined
2. **Session Expiration Detection**: Monitor user session state changes
3. **User Notification**: Display clear toast message about session expiration
4. **Automatic Redirect**: Navigate to login page with proper cleanup
5. **Role-Based Routing**: Ensure users access only their authorized dashboards

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Import Dependencies
```typescript
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import { toast } from "@/components/ui/use-toast";
```

### 2. Hook Usage
```typescript
const { user, profile, signOut, loading } = useAuth();
const navigate = useNavigate();
```

### 3. Authentication Check (Session Expiration)
```typescript
// Check authentication and redirect if session expired
useEffect(() => {
  if (!loading && !user) {
    console.log('🔒 User session expired or not authenticated, redirecting to login');
    toast({
      title: "Session Expired",
      description: "Your session has expired. Please log in again to continue.",
      variant: "destructive"
    });
    navigate('/auth', { replace: true });
  }
}, [user, loading, navigate]);
```

### 4. Role-Based Authorization
```typescript
// Check user role and redirect if unauthorized
useEffect(() => {
  if (!loading && user && profile) {
    if (profile.role !== 'expected_role') {
      console.log('🔒 User has incorrect role, redirecting to appropriate dashboard');
      // Redirect based on actual role
      if (profile.role === 'admin') {
        navigate('/admin', { replace: true });
      } else if (profile.role === 'bank_viewer') {
        navigate('/bank', { replace: true });
      } else if (profile.role === 'specialist') {
        navigate('/specialist', { replace: true });
      } else {
        navigate('/auth', { replace: true });
      }
    }
  }
}, [user, profile, loading, navigate]);
```

### 5. Loading State Display
```typescript
// Show loading state while checking authentication
if (loading) {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-background dark:bg-dark-bg transition-colors flex items-center justify-center">
      <div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-4">
        <div className="h-12 w-12 rounded-full border-4 border-primary border-t-transparent animate-spin"></div>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground">Loading...</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 6. Prevent Rendering Before Redirect
```typescript
// Don't render dashboard if user is not authenticated (will be redirected by useEffect)
if (!user || !profile) {
  return null;
}
```

## 📦 Files Modified

### Dashboard Components
- **`src/pages/SpecialistDashboard.tsx`**: Added session expiration detection and redirect logic
- **`src/pages/BankDashboard.tsx`**: Added session expiration detection and redirect logic
- **`src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`**: Updated from `Navigate` component to consistent useEffect pattern

### Hooks (Already Implemented)
- **`src/hooks/useAuth.ts`**: Provides `user`, `profile`, `loading`, and `signOut` state

---

## 🔒 Security Benefits

### 1. **Automatic Session Cleanup**
- Prevents unauthorized access to protected routes
- Redirects immediately when session expires
- No sensitive data exposure after logout

### 2. **Clear User Communication**
- Toast notification explains why redirect occurred
- "Session Expired" message is user-friendly and clear
- Reduces user confusion and support tickets

### 3. **Role-Based Access Control**
- Users are automatically routed to correct dashboards
- Prevents role escalation attempts
- Ensures proper authorization at all times

### 4. **Consistent Security Pattern**
- All dashboards follow the same authentication flow
- Easier to audit and maintain security posture
- Reduces risk of implementation gaps

---

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

### Session Expiration Scenario
1. User is working in dashboard (e.g., Specialist Dashboard)
2. Session token expires (JWT timeout, manual logout, etc.)
3. `useAuth` hook detects `user` is now `null`
4. `useEffect` triggers and shows toast: **"Session Expired - Your session has expired. Please log in again to continue."**
5. User is automatically redirected to `/auth` (login page)
6. User sees login form and can re-authenticate
7. After successful login, user returns to appropriate dashboard based on role

### Role Mismatch Scenario
1. User navigates to wrong dashboard (e.g., Specialist accessing `/admin`)
2. `useEffect` detects role mismatch
3. User is automatically redirected to correct dashboard without notification (seamless)
4. If no valid dashboard exists for role, redirect to `/auth`

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Test session expiration by clearing localStorage while on dashboard
- [ ] Test manual logout from dashboard
- [ ] Test accessing dashboard URLs directly without authentication
- [ ] Test role-based redirects (e.g., specialist trying to access /admin)
- [ ] Test deep links while unauthenticated (should redirect to /auth)
- [ ] Verify toast message appears on session expiration
- [ ] Verify loading spinner shows during authentication check
- [ ] Test in both light and dark modes

### Automated Testing (Recommended)
```typescript
// Example test case
describe('Session Expiration Handling', () => {
  it('should redirect to login when session expires', async () => {
    // Mock expired session
    mockUseAuth({ user: null, profile: null, loading: false });
    
    render(<SpecialistDashboard />);
    
    // Should show toast
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText('Session Expired')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
    
    // Should redirect to /auth
    expect(mockNavigate).toHaveBeenCalledWith('/auth', { replace: true });
  });
});
```

## 🔍 Debugging

### Console Logging
All authentication redirects log to console with 🔒 emoji prefix:
```
🔒 User session expired or not authenticated, redirecting to login
🔒 User has incorrect role, redirecting to appropriate dashboard
```

### Common Issues

#### Issue: Infinite Redirect Loop
**Cause**: Auth hook not properly detecting session state  
**Solution**: Check `useAuth` implementation and ensure `loading` state is correctly managed

#### Issue: Toast Not Appearing
**Cause**: Toast component not mounted in app  
**Solution**: Ensure `<Toaster />` or `<Sonner />` is rendered in main `App.tsx`

#### Issue: Redirect Not Working
**Cause**: React Router not properly configured  
**Solution**: Verify `BrowserRouter` wraps the app and routes are correctly defined

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Session Timeout Warning**: Show warning 2 minutes before expiration
2. **Automatic Session Refresh**: Refresh tokens automatically in background
3. **Remember Last Page**: Redirect back to last visited page after re-login
4. **Session Activity Tracking**: Log user activity for security audits
5. **Multi-Device Session Management**: Allow users to view/revoke active sessions

### Considerations
- **Performance**: Monitor redirect performance on slow connections
- **Analytics**: Track session expiration frequency to optimize timeout duration
- **UX**: Consider less disruptive notifications for session refresh
